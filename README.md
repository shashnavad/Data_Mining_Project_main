 CSE 572 Project - Fake job posting predictor

Online job portals have made job searching incredibly convenient, but they have also opened the doors for scammers to exploit unsuspecting job seekers. Fake job listings are often created to steal personal information, trick applicants into paying fraudulent fees, or even convince them to perform unpaid work.

The challenge is that many fake job postings look professional and well-written, making them difficult to detect manually. Some job platforms do not verify every job posting.

Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze job postings and predict whether they are real or fraudulent with high accuracy.

This project would help job seekers avoid scams and job platforms in improving trust and safety.
